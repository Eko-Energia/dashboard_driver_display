## Driver Screen
The driver screen is still under development, current design is outdated. The new frontend will be developed by Martyna Szewczyk once we receive the final survey results and the completed design assets.
The CAN communication layer I created for testing will be fully replaced with the unified version developed by Olek Jóźwik once it becomes available.
